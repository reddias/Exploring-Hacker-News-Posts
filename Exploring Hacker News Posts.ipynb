    "The study looked at the types of posts that received the most comments and the times when they received the most comments. According to our analysis, we would recommend categorizing the post as a question post and creating it between 15:00 and 16:00 (3:00 pm est - 4:00 pm est) to maximize the amount of comments a post receives.\n",

    "Note, however, that the dataset we analyzed excluded posts that did not contain a comment. Given that, it's more accurate to say that, of the posts that received comments, ask posts received more comments on average, and ask posts created between 3:00pm and 4:00pm (15:00pm - 4:00pm EST) received the most comments on average."
